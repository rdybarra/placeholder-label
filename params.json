  "body": "## Sometimes, on forms, you want to see some sort of label after the placeholder goes away when typing.\r\n\r\n![demonstration](http://rdybarra.com/images/placeholder-label.gif)\r\n\r\nThis script takes fields with labels and turns the labels into placeholders. It then shows the label if there is field value. If there is no field value, then the placeholder is shown. Placeholders are automatically created based on the label text.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nChoose a selector that contains the label/field pairs you want to be affected. In this case we can use `.placeholder-label`. \r\n\r\nYou use that selector in the constructor (or function)\r\n\r\n### Usage with common.js\r\n```\r\nimport PlaceholderLabel from './placeholder-label';\r\n\r\nlet placeholderLabel = new PlaceholderLabel('.placeholder-label');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage inline\r\n```\r\n  <script src=\"/build/placeholder-label.js\"></script>\r\n  <script>\r\n    placeholderLabel('.placeholder-label');\r\n  </script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nEither of the following two styles of markup is allowed:\r\n```\r\n<label for=\"input1\">First Name</label>\r\n<input id=\"input1\" type=\"text\">\r\n\r\n<label>Last Name\r\n  <input type=\"text\">\r\n</label>\r\n```\r\nIn the second version, the markup is adjust to wrap the text node in a `span` tag.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nCurrently there are no options. It uses opacity to change the labels, and when appropriate, toggles a class on the label called `label-is-visible`.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\nI use Babel to convert to es5:\r\n```\r\nbabel src/placeholder-label.js -o build/placeholder-label.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nI knew I wanted the code to be used both as an inline script and as a module. I found some guidance here: http://oli.me.uk/2013/07/21/exporting-through-amd-commonjs-and-the-global-object/\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism is welcome.",
